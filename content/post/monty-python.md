Burn her!

Burn her! And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. Did you dress her up like this? â€¦Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!

Camelot! And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. Shut up! Will you shut up?! I dunno. Must be a king. Be quiet! I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!
The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.

Look, my liege! Well, how'd you become king, then? On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. Camelot! Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni!

    Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
    The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice!
    Why do you think that she is a witch?

She looks like one. I have to push the pram a lot. Did you dress her up like this? The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice! And the hat. She's a witch!

    Shut up! Will you shut up?!
    The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice!
    Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods.

Shut up! Shut up! Will you shut up?! Burn her! What do you mean? How do you know she is a witch?
