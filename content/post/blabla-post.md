Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think?

I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone.

I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.

I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. Red Five standing by. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.

    I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.
    Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.

You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Partially, but it also obeys your commands. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.

    Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think?

    He is here.

I find your lack of faith disturbing. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? I'm trying not to, kid. Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.

I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? You mean it controls your actions? Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.

What!? I find your lack of faith disturbing. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--

Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more likeâ€¦suicide.
